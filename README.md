There can be any number of clients connected to each slave, and any sumber of slaves connected to a master but there can only be one master server.

#Windows setup

Clusterio is built up of multiple parts. Here is a quick guide:

Master = master.js

Slave = client.js + factorio server

Client = The people connecting to the server

Master and all all Slaves have to be running nodejs. Get it from nodejs.org.

All Slaves AND Clients need to be running the clusterio mod located in this repository. Install it by dropping it into the mods folder.

There are no requirements for other mods, they can be ran in any configuration allowed by the base game.

**Requirements**

download and install nodeJS 6+ from http://nodejs.org

download and install git from https://git-scm.com/

reboot when you are done, then proceed to the next steps. *reboots matter*

**Master**

1. Download this repository

2.     npm install

3.     node master.js

**Slave**

1. Download this repository

2. Unzip to desktop (or other folder)

3. Place your factorio server folder inside of factorioClusterio/, making it factorioClusterio/factorio

To connect to a master server running on a remote machine, open config.json with your favourite text editor (notepad++)

Change masterIP to something like 31.152.123.14 (provided by master server owner)

Change masterPort to something like 8080 (provided by master server owner)

4. Open a cmd window by shift + right clicking in exlporer (https://puu.sh/tozfj/e3fd0acf6f.png Ã…pne kommando vindu her/open command window here) 

5. Type

    node client.js start [instancename]
    
 to create a new instance.

Repeat step 4 and 5 for more servers on one machine. You should be able to find its port by looking at the console output or at the slave section on master:8080 (the web interface)

**Client**

Alternative experimental client: [clusterioClient](https://github.com/Danielv123/factorioClusterioClient)

1. Download the same version of the mod as the slave is running from [the mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Danielv123/clusterio) or [github](https://github.com/Danielv123/factorioClusterioMod

2. Drop it into ./factorio/mods

3. Run factorio and connect to slave as a normal MP game.

#Ubuntu setup

NodeJS does not support EOL ubuntu releases. Make sure you are on the most recent LTS release or newer.

Master and all slaves:

    sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install -y git nodejs && git clone https://github.com/Danielv123/factorioClusterio.git && cd factorioClusterio && npm install && curl -o factorio.tar.gz -L https://www.factorio.com/get-download/latest/headless/linux64 && tar -xvzf factorio.tar.gz

downloads and installs nodejs, git and clusterio. To specify a version, change "latest" in the link to a version number like 0.14.21.

**Master**

    node master.js
    
**Slave**
